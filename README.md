# ECG-Apnea-Arrythmia-Detection.
The gold standard method for sleep apnea diagnosis is Polysomnography (PSG) or sleep study, which requires overnight recordings of multiple electrophysiological signals<br /> in sleep laboratories with specialized equipment and attending personnel, thus impractical as a screening test. So, the aim of this project is to use <br />various deep learning techniques to find an efficient and reliable way to diagnose Obstructive Sleep Apnea using less no of signals(we are using ECG and Spo2 only).<br />
